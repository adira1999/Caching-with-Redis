# Caching-with-Redis
This project demonstrates the implementation of server-side caching using Redis in a Spring Boot application. The application fetches weather data and caches it to improve response times and reduce backend load. Redis serves as the caching layer, with caching set up to store weather information with a Time-To-Live (TTL) setting.
